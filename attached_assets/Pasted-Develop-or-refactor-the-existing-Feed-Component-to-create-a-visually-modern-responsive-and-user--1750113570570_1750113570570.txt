Develop or refactor the existing 'Feed Component' to create a visually modern, responsive, and user-friendly display for quotes on the page. Leverage PrimeNG components for a polished look and enhanced user experience.

For each quote, the following information must be prominently and clearly displayed:

User Information (above the quote):

User Name: (e.g., "Jane Doe")
User Nickname: (e.g., "@janedoe_reads")
Quote Details:

Quote Text: The main content of the quote, presented clearly and legibly.
Author: The name of the author.
Book Name: The title of the book from which the quote originates.
Design and Functionality Requirements:

Modern Aesthetic:

Utilize PrimeNG's styling and thematic capabilities to achieve a clean, contemporary, and minimalist design.
Consider using PrimeNG Card or Panel components for individual quote containers to provide clear visual separation and elevation.
Ensure consistent typography and spacing for readability.
Responsiveness:

The component must be fully responsive, adapting gracefully to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using PrimeFlex utilities or PrimeNG's built-in responsive features.
Ensure optimal layout and readability on all devices.
PrimeNG Component Usage (Suggestions):

Layout: PrimeFlex Grid System (p-grid, p-col) for arranging elements within each quote and the overall feed.
Display:
p-card or p-panel for each quote entry.
p-avatar (if user profile images are to be included later) for user representation.
Standard HTML elements enhanced with PrimeNG typography and spacing classes.
Data Iteration: Utilize p-dataView or ngFor with appropriate PrimeNG components for efficient rendering of the quote list.
Clarity and Readability:

Ensure that each piece of information (user, quote, author, book) is easily distinguishable and legible.
Prioritize the quote text visually.
Interactivity (Optional but Recommended for 'Modern'):

Consider placeholders or basic implementation for features like 'Share,' 'Like,' or 'Copy Quote' actions using PrimeNG Button or SplitButton components.
If applicable, think about how filters or sorting might be integrated using PrimeNG Dropdown or MultiSelect.
Technical Considerations:

Ensure proper data binding from your component's TypeScript logic to the PrimeNG templates.
Structure the HTML and SCSS for maintainability and adherence to Angular best practices.
The goal is to create an engaging and intuitive experience for users Browse quotes.
